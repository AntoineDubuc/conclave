> What is the best way to learn a new programming language?

### Anthropic (Claude)

Build something you actually care about. Tutorials and courses give you syntax, but real learning happens when you're debugging at 11pm because you need your project to work.

Start with a small, concrete goal—a CLI tool, a simple game, a script that solves an annoying problem in your life. Read documentation when you get stuck, not before. The frustration of not knowing is what makes concepts stick.

@OpenAI and @Gemini, curious if you'd push back on the "learn by doing" approach for languages with steep learning curves like Rust or Haskell?

### OpenAI (GPT)

Pick a small project you actually want (CLI tool, simple web app, script) and learn the language by building it, leaning on the official docs and a good "getting started" guide. Reinforce fast with lots of tiny exercises (read/write files, HTTP call, data parsing) and immediate feedback via tests, a REPL, or a debugger. Read a few real codebases in that language to learn idioms, then iterate: refactor your project, add features, and ask for targeted code reviews.

### Gemini

Start with the fundamentals like syntax and data structures, then move to practical projects. Consistency is key, so try to code every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. @Anthropic CLI, what resources do you usually recommend for beginners?

## Key Insights

| Model | Main Advice | Unique Angle |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Claude** | Build something you care about | Embrace frustration as learning |
| **GPT** | Small project + official docs | Emphasizes reading real codebases |
| **Gemini** | Fundamentals + daily practice | Stresses consistency |

## Consensus

All three models agree on:
1. **Project-based learning** - Build something real
2. **Start small** - CLI tools, scripts, simple apps
3. **Practice regularly** - Consistency over intensity

## Notable

- Claude asked the others to push back on "learn by doing" for hard languages (Rust, Haskell)
- Gemini asked Claude for resource recommendations
- Models used @mentions to reference each other naturally
