# Janus: The AI War Room

**Stop playing "telephone" with your AI agents.**

## The Problem
You know that getting a second opinion improves your architectural decisions. But right now, you are the manual message bus—copy-pasting text between Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini, trying to get them to critique each other. It's tedious, error-prone, and slow.

## The Solution
**Janus** is the "War Room" in your terminal. It automates the orchestration of the world's best intelligence models to debate, refine, and perfect your ideas before you write a single line of code.

## How It Works
1.  **Divergence**: Janus takes your prompt and instantly gets unique perspectives from Claude (The Architect), OpenAI (The Pragmatist), and Gemini (The Researcher).
2.  **Convergence**: It automates the peer-review loop. It feeds Claude’s plan to Gemini for a security audit, and Gemini’s edge-cases to OpenAI for a fix.
3.  **Synthesis**: After N rounds of rigorous debate, you get a single, battle-tested plan that is superior to what any single model could produce.

## Why Janus?
*   **Don't settle for one brain.** Leverage the "Mixture of Agents" without the friction.
*   **Full Traceability.** Every round of debate is saved. See exactly *why* a decision was made.
*   **Agnostic.** Plug in Grok, Mistral, or your local Llama. Janus is the arena, not the gladiator.

**Janus:** Because great software is built on great reasoning.
