  "summary": "All four runtime verifications passed. The synthesis API endpoint correctly handles valid requests (returning 200 with a synthesized task description), missing transcripts (400), empty transcripts (400), and invalid providers (400 with descriptive error message). The endpoint compiles and responds without errors on the first hit (compilation took 122ms, subsequent requests use cached compilation). Screenshots confirm the /flows/new page renders correctly showing the flow creation options, and the advanced mode (?mode=advanced) renders the Advanced Flow Builder with the multi-step progress bar and model selection interface. Server logs show zero compilation errors, zero runtime exceptions, and all HTTP responses returned expected status codes."
